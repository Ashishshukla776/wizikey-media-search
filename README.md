## Playwright Setup & Execution

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```
npm install
```

### **2. Install Playwright Browsers**
```
npx playwright install
```
### **3. Run All Tests in headless mode**
```
npx playwright test
```
Note: Test will run on three popular brower (Crome, Firefox and Safari-Webkit). It insure Cross-browsing testing

### **4. Run Tests in UI mode (optional)**
```
npx playwright test --ui
```
### **5. Run a Specific Test File(optional)**
```
npx playwright test wizikey/media_search.spec.ts
```
### **6. View Test Report**
```
npx playwright show-report
```
### **7. Additional Notes (Optional but Useful)**

- Playwright tests run by default in headless mode, ensuring faster execution using ```npx playwright test```.
- Running tests in UI mode helps visually debug the test flow using ```npx playwright test --ui```.
- Playwright automatically executes tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, providing cross-browser coverage out of the box.

- The test report generated by show-report provides detailed information such as:
```
    Passed/failed tests.
    Error stack traces.
    Screenshots (if enabled).
    Execution timeline.
```
- No extra configuration is required to start — Playwright sets up browsers and dependencies automatically. 
## Tools & Technologies Used
```
1. Playwright (TypeScript)
2. Node.js
3. VS Code
4. Chrome / Edge for manual testing
5. Markdown for documentation
```

## Optional: Viewing .md Files Locally

All project reports are written in Markdown (.md) format.
GitHub automatically renders these files with proper formatting.

If you want to preview .md files locally, you can either:

Use any code editor with Markdown preview
```
VS Code → Press Ctrl + Shift + V

Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, etc.
```
Or use any Markdown viewer of your choice.
